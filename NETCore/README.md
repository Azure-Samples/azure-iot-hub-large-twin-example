# Azure IoT Hub Large Twin Example for .NET

This sample demonstrates how to extend Azure IoT Hub Twins via Azure Blob Storage. Concretely, a solution can benefit from this approach if the twin properties either exceed the current limit or refer to binary content that cannot be easily represented in the twin's JSON payload.

## Features
This project framework provides the following features:

* Enable Device Twin and Module Tiwn to pull properties from Azure Blob Storage
* Report and download properties when the Blob is updated

## Getting Started
